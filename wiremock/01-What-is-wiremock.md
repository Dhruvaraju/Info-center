# What is wiremock?
#wiremock

Wiremock is a flexible api mocking tool, which is opensource and freeware. It can be run standalone as well as few other options. It can be used as a library by any JVM application, or run as a standalone process either on the same host as the system under test or a remote server.

All of Wire Mockâ€™s features are accessible via its REST (JSON) interface and its Java API. Additionally, stubs can be configured via JSON files.

Documentation for wiremock is present at https://wiremock.org/docs/

Standalone jar can be downloaded from:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock-jre8-standalone/2.35.0/wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.35.0.jar

To start the stand alone version place the jar in a folder and run it using the following command

```commandline
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.35.0.jar --port 9099
```

Wire mock will be up and running on port 9099, if you are using another version of jar replace it with name of jar file.
